/**
 * Adapter that simply returns row views from a list.
 * <p/>
 * If you supply a size, you must implement newView(), to
 * create a required view. The adapter will then cache these
 * views.
 * <p/>
 * If you supply a list of views in the constructor, that
 * list will be used directly. If any elements in the list
 * are null, then newView() will be called just for those
 * slots.
 * <p/>
 * Subclasses may also wish to override areAllItemsEnabled()
 * (default: false) and isEnabled() (default: false), if some
 * of their rows should be selectable.
 * <p/>
 * It is assumed each view is unique, and therefore will not
 * get recycled.
 * <p/>
 * Note that this adapter is not designed for long lists. It
 * is more for screens that should behave like a list. This
 * is particularly useful if you combine this with other
 * adapters (e.g., SectionedAdapter) that might have an
 * arbitrary number of rows, so it all appears seamless.
